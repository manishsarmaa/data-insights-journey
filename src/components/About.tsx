                I'm an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Pythonâ€”tools I use to turn raw data into clear, actionable insights. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I discovered my passion for data analysis while exploring patterns, trends, and stories hidden in numbers.

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">  
                Though I haven't worked in a formal corporate setting yet, I've completed multiple business-focused data projects, which you'll find in my portfolio below. Each one showcases my ability to solve real-world problems through data, whether it's cleaning datasets, building dashboards, or drawing strategic conclusions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">  
                I'm now looking to bring my skills, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset into a dynamic team where I can grow and make a real impact through data.
